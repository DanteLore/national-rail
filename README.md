# National Rail

There are many parts to this repo, doing simple things with the National Rail SOAP API. Feel free to use bits and bobs as it suits you, with attribution of course!

* Scripts to collect and store data are in "collectors"
* An AngularJS departure board can be found in "ui/departure-board"
* A map app showing live routing animations can be found in "ui/route-map"
